# DiNO
self-**Di**stillation with **NO** labels

[DINO (Distillation with No Labels)](./CONCEPTS.md/#DINO) is a method applied to the [Vision Transformer (ViT)](./CONCEPTS.md/#VIT) using a [self-supervised learning](./CONCEPTS.md/#SSL) approach. This technique reveals that the self-supervised features from ViT inherently possess information pertinent to the [semantic segmentation](./CONCEPTS.md/#seg) of images. Moreover, these extracted features serve as highly effective [k-NN classifiers](./CONCEPTS.md/#KNN).
